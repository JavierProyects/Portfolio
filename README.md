<h2>üá™üá∏üá∫üá∏ About Me</h2>

- Welcome to my profile! I'm a passionate and driven individual who embarked on a remarkable journey from Spain to the United States in 2018. I came with a soccer scholarship that opened the doors to a world of opportunities. My path led me to the University of South Carolina Upstate, where I earned my bachelor's degree in Management & Information Systems in the spring of 2022.

- Eager to continue my pursuit of knowledge and expand my skill set, I made my way to Lowell, MA. In December 2023, I completed a master's degree in Business Analytics from the University of Massachusetts Lowell. This dynamic program has been equipping me with analytical tools and strategies that enable me to make data-driven decisions and contribute meaningfully to the evolving business landscape.

- My experiences as an international student-athlete have cultivated not only my determination and resilience but also my ability to work collaboratively within diverse teams. I am deeply enthusiastic about the intersection of data, management, and strategy, and I'm eager to leverage these passions to drive innovative solutions and insights that create positive impacts.

- As I move forward, I am excited about the prospect of connecting with like-minded professionals, collaborators, and mentors. If you're interested in exploring how my diverse background and education could contribute to your team or project, I welcome the opportunity to connect. Let's embark on this exciting journey together!
